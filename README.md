# 8 Puzzle Solver
This is a project for UCR Artificial Intelligence 
There are three finished code:

File Name | Description
---|---
8puzzle.cpp | An 8 puzzle solver
myGame8puzzle.cpp | A mini 8 puzzle game
priorityQ.cpp | A priority queue structure

The 8 puzzle solver is based on three different search algorithm:

1. Uniform Cost Search
2. A* with Misplace tile
3. A* with Manhattan Distance

For Union Cost Search, all the cost are the same. It was coded same way as Breadth First Search
For A*, misplace tile is the upcoming cost that counts how many tile that are misplaced; Manhattan distance counts how many step it would required to put every tile back to the correct place
